Browser extension for Google Chrome that fetches the list of OS's and browsers supported by BrowserStack using the BrowserStack REST API and provides:

Drop-down menus to select OS and Browser based on above list
A text input field to enter a URL
A submit button
Once a user selects an OS and a browser and enters a text input field, clicking the submit button should open a session with that OS, browser and URL using the BrowserStack Integrations API. The BrowserStack session should open in full screen. You can fetch the list of browsers from here.
